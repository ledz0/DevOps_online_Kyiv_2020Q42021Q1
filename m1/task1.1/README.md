**DevOps for me**

In my opinion, DevOps is a software engineer, that combines part work of developer and system enginner. DevOps makes and customizes the cloud environment. Should be responsible for CI / CD proccess. In other words supports cloud, installes and customizes operation system, database, web server and other software for fast development.
